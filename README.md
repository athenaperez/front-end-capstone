<h2>Front End Capstone, Nashville Software School, Cohort 17.</h2>

<p>Society Wild is a community for landscape photographers and outdoor enthusiasts to share locations for outdoor adventures and photo ops.</p>

<p>I am an amateur photographer with a passion for outdoor photography. Finding a location (like the banner image, for example) can be difficult to locate and navigate. The banner image for the Society Wild web application is at the top of a mountain range and can be very difficult to locate if one is not well trained in navigation. I created Society Wild so people like me - that love outdoor photography and backcountry camping/hiking, but are not skilled navigators - can share and search backcountry locations (directions, trailheads, landmarks, trails, tips, etc.).</p>
