<h2>Front End Capstone, Nashville Software School, Cohort 17</h2>

<i>Society Wild is a community for landscape photographers and outdoor enthusiasts to share locations for outdoor adventures and photo ops.</i>

<p>I am an amateur photographer with a passion for outdoor photography. In my experience, finding a backcountry location for that killer shot can be difficult - especially finding and navigating to and through these locations. The banner image for the Society Wild web application is at the top of a mountain range and would be very difficult to locate if one is not well trained in navigation. I created Society Wild so people like me - that love outdoor photography and backcountry camping/hiking, but are not skilled navigators - can share and find backcountry locations (directions, trailheads, landmarks, trails, tips, etc.).</p>

<p>Developed as my front-end capstone project for Nashville Software School.
<br>A CRUD application:
<li>Create stories</li>
<li>Naviagate and read all user's submitted stories on the front page</li>
<li>Update stories - add stories to your 'Favorites'</li>
<li>Delete stories and remove from your 'Favorites'</li>
<li>Functioning authentication, handled by Firebase</li>
<li>Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, Materialize, and Firebase</li>
